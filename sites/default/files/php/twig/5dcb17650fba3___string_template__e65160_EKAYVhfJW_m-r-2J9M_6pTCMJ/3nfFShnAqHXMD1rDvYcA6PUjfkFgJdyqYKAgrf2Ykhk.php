<p>Psychosis describes various kinds of symptoms where there are changes in perception, sight, sounds, and thoughts that are different from others experience. Sometimes these changes can be due to sleep, stress, or life changes (moving into a new home). &nbsp;&nbsp;Most people scoring in this range are functioning well and do not have serious problems.</p>

<p>If you notice that your vision, sounds, thoughts, or behaviors get worse or do not improve, you may want to screen again and start a conversation with someone you trust.</p>

<p>These results do not mean that you do or do not have a mental health problem.&nbsp; Only a trained medical professional can help you and your family figure that out.</p>

<p><b>Based on your answers, you may have been feeling like your eyes, ears, or brain has been playing tricks on you.&nbsp; These experiences may be causing difficulty in school, with relationships, in your family, and/or with everyday activities.</b></p>

<p>The best thing to do is get information and reach out to someone and get help.</p>

<p>Psychosis include changes in perception, sight, sounds, and thoughts that are different from others experience.&nbsp; When these changes occur during a young age and people recognize that they aren’t supposed to have these experiences, this period can be the early signs of a developing illness (called prodrome).&nbsp; When someone loses insight (they do not know the difference between what is real versus not real) this can be a sign of the onset of an illness, like Schizophrenia.</p>

<p>These results do not mean that you have a mental illness.&nbsp; But, if you haven’t already done so, now is great time to start a conversation with your support system: a parent, mentor, or someone you trust about how you are doing. &nbsp;Finding the right help and working with people who can support you can help you feel and do better again.</p>

<p>This screen is not meant to be a diagnosis. &nbsp;Having the early warning signs of psychosis (prodrome) is different from having a diagnosable psychotic disorder. &nbsp;In addition, psychosis can be caused by other factors, like stress, lack of sleep, recent life changes (starting a new school or changing homes), trauma, a recent loss in the family, drug use, health problems, changes in hormones, or a head injury. &nbsp;Only a trained professional, such as a doctor or a mental health provider, can help you and your family figure that out. It is highly recommended that since you scored At Risk on this screening, you should get assessed by a psychiatrist or mental health professional – preferably using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndrome (SIPS).&nbsp; Printing or emailing the results of this screening and showing them to someone you trust can help start the conversation.</p>
